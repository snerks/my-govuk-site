# GOV.UK, but it's personal

Are you a well-seasoned open-sourcerer and love the work that the UK Gov Digital Services do?

Are you also like me and have a bit of a _thing_ for the GOV.UK Design System?

The only sane solution would be to turn GDS's production Design System kit into a personal website.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm create govuk-personal@latest
cd my-govuk-site
npm run dev
```

See more information here: [govuk.wilkin.xyz](https://govuk.wilkin.xyz/quickstart/).

## Why it can't look exactly like GOV.UK

> If your service is not on a service.gov.uk domain, you cannot use the GOV.UK crown logo.

This template uses a custom logo placeholder.

> You also will not be able to use the New Transport font. Use the Helvetica or Arial CSS font stacks instead.

GDS Transport has been substituted for Helvetica.
